# The PHP Specification Test Suite

If you pass this suite, you aren't necessarily spec compliant, but it is a helpful bellwether.

## Usage

PHP's run-tests.php test runner is included. To run the test suite, do this:

    TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/php php run-tests.php tests

Replace `/usr/bin/php` with the path to a different PHP executable, if necessary.
